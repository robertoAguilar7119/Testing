PORTAL REVIEW
Share. The cake may be a lie, but the fun isn't.
BY DAN ADAMS When students from DigiPen showed off their project Narbacular Drop to a room full of Valve personell, they probably didn't expect that they would not only be hired, but given a budget to expand that idea into something as special as we see with Portal. It's quirky, clever, polished, and presented with a spark of a subtly evil humor that it's hard not to enjoy the quick romp through Aperture Laboratories. The problem is that it is so quick. Players wanting to get their money's worth will want to play through again and definitely check out the challenges.



Portal uses a concept that's a bit hard to wrap your head around without actually seeing it in action. The only "weapon" you're given is a portal gun that can shoot a portal entrance with the right mouse button and a portal exit with the left mouse button. Once both portals have been placed, you can walk though the entrance and find yourself at the exit. Walk through the exit and you're back at the entrance. The portals can be shot across a distance but only on certain surfaces, which creates the puzzle atmosphere. You'll have to figure out how to get across chasms, up and over obstacles, and around automated turrets. The trick is that you can only have one entrance and one exit meaning sometimes you'll encounter several kinds of brain teasers on how to use the portals correctly, and in some cases, quickly and often. It'll make you think about which portal you're placing, the exact location of where it needs to go, and the timing of when portals need to be switched.</p>
